# To Do List Using PHP and Azure.

This application is for my FYP of 3rd year. I decided to create a To Do List web app using PHP and have it hosted on Azure with a SQL server running on that. It was my envision to get a user login working and also giving the user the option to mark a task as done rather than jsut deleting the element of the list.

## What I acomlpished for my deadline

I finally got the project up and running after much trouble with PHP drivers on my laptop. What the application does for now is add, update and delete. Once the app is opened the list of all lists in the database is showing on screen. I am happy with the progess I made but I know for the future that I MUST handle my time better and factor in problems occuring that may take more than one day to correct. While I am a hard worker I need to consider the amount of time needed to research and develop the application. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to connect to the database server on Azure and then used it to make the tables so they could then be populated by a user.

## References
I mostly used the docs available for Azure to help with the PHP but I also used stackover flow for any tricker problems I had.

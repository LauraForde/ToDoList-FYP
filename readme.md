To Do List Using PHP and Azure.

This application is for my FYP of 3rd year. I decided to create a To Do List web app using PHP and have it hosted on Azure with a SQL server running on that. It was my envision to get a user login working and also giving the user the option to mark a task as done rather than jsut deleting the element of the list.
